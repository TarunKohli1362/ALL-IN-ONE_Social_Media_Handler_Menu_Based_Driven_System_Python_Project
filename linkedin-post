🚀 New Project: Python Automation Toolkit 🛠️  

I recently built a **menu-driven Python project** that combines multiple automation tasks into one program — a small step towards centralizing automation workflows.  

✨ Features included:  
1️⃣ Post on Instagram (via Zapier/Instabot demo)  
2️⃣ Send Email (real Gmail SMTP with App Passwords)  
3️⃣ Send SMS (mock demo)  
4️⃣ Post on LinkedIn (content saved to Excel → Zapier auto-post)  
5️⃣ Tweet on Twitter (mock demo)  
6️⃣ Send WhatsApp Messages (mock demo)  

💡 Why I built this:  
I wanted to explore how Python could act as a **central automation hub**, bridging different platforms like email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and social media.  
Even though some features are **mock/Zapier-based demos**, email automation is **fully functional**, and the structure makes it easy to extend with real APIs (Twilio, Twitter API v2, Instagram Graph API, etc.).  

🔑 Key Learnings:  
✔️ Gmail SMTP with App Passwords for secure automation  
✔️ Excel file integration for LinkedIn + Zapier workflows  
✔️ Designing extendable menu-driven Python applications  

This project taught me that Python is not just about scripts — it’s about **creating automation ecosystems**.
